# Wine_ML

Summary

This ML project is designed to accurately predict the quality of wine in the Bordeaux region of France; therefore affecting the price. It is widely known that older wines typically taste better and consequently fetch a higher price. Wine buyers profit from knowing in advance which young wines will taste better in the future.

I used a multi-variable linear regression in RStudio with price as my dependent variable (outcome variable) and independent variables of weather and age to predict wine prices. I created a total of five ML models and used a test dataset (wine_test.csv) that contained actual wine prices from 1979 - 1980 to verify that my model was accurate.
